# LinearSolver
Linear Systems solver using elementary operations on Matricies



Current Features
* Given a linear system, evaluates the Echelon and Reduced Echelon form
* Reads and parses equation input into an augmented matrix.


Features Currently being Considered for Development (in no particular order)
* Inverse Finder
* Step by step Echelon and Augmented Echelon Solver.
* Present answers in variable form for an linear system rather than as
    an augmented matrix.
* Matrix input -> Allows for input split by , or just in muliple boxes.
